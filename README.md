## send file using winsock


</div>

### Description

send files using winsock control.

This project demonstrates how to send a file to a remote

computer using the Winsock control. One side is the

server and the other is the client. Only the server can

send a file to the client. The client is then promted if

they want to accept the file. Before the server sends the

file, there has to be a connection. If you are the server,

click "HOST" to listen for incoming connections.When

the client connects to you (by putting your IP address

in the Remote IP field and clicking "CONNECT"), you

can select a file and send it.

Ohhh...yeah... and please vote!!!
